Projects using Machine Learning

In this repository, I uploaded projects I have done or I am working on.
All projects are done by using Jupyter notebook. In order to run all codes, you need to update all libraries to latest version. A few visualizations may not be presented due to the unstableness of Plotly but re-running the code will solve this problem.
