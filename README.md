Projects using Machine Learning

In this repository, I uploaded projects I have done or I am working on.
All projects are done by using Jupyter notebook. In order to run all codes, you need to update all libraries to latest version. 
Some visualizations may not be presented because Github does not support interactive plots. To view all plots, use the nbviewer.
